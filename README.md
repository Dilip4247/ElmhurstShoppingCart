Users can access the websites in this project, register, and log in.  They have the ability to view every product that is available for purchase, search and filter items according to various categories, and then add items to their basket.  They can change the quantity in the cart as well as add more or fewer items.  After the cart has been updated, the user can click the credit card payment details to continue to the checkout page.  Orders will be placed as soon as the payment is successful, and users will be able to view the order information and product delivery status in the orders section.

Since the administrator is in charge of adding products to the store, updating existing items, deleting items from the store, and controlling inventories, the administrator is also crucial to this project.  The administrator has the ability to view every product order that has been placed and, depending on the circumstances, mark them as shipped or delivered.

One of the best features of the projects is the ability to mail customers. This means that after a user registers on the website, they will receive an email confirming their successful registration. Additionally, the user will receive an email confirming their order whenever they place an order or when a product is shipped from the store.  Users will occasionally receive an email when an item becomes available again if they attempt to add an item that is currently out of stock.

Note: The payment page is not completely connected with any payment gateway; it was made purely for demonstration purposes.  Thus, demo orders will be placed and any credit card information will be accepted for the time being.

The users will get a mail to their registered mail Id during:-
New User Registration
Order Successfully Placed
The Item was out of stock while exploring but now it got available in the store
Successful shipment and delivery of the Item
